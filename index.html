    <p id="lhistory">
      David Crowder was born November 29, 1971 in Texarkana, TX. As a child,,
      Crowder always had a love for music and found himself dancing along to the
      beats of Elvis, Willie Nelson, Olivia Newton John, and Bill Gaither. He
      was attending Baylor University when his musical career began.

      is a Christian college and David was surprised to find out that many
      students were not attending church. He decided he would try and change
      this, therefore, the University Baptist Church was born in 1995. The
      church consisted of 20 members in the beginning, but quickly grew. He went
      on to form the David Crowder Band and was very successful until retiring
      in 2012. He knew that God still had plans for his musical career and he
      made the decision to start writing songs and singing again. This time he
      would perform solo. Crowder released his first debut solo studio album on
      May 27, 2014,
      <i>Neon Steeple</i> with many more to follow. He has had huge success in
      life with a net worth of about 6 million and now resides in
      <a href="https://discoveratlanta.com/">Atlanta, GA</a> with his wife of 30
      years, Toni.
